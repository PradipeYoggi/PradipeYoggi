### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a VP of Engineering on a SaaS Business suite that helps businesses manage their marketing and online presence covering Social media management, SEO, advertising, online reputation, directory listings and email marketing. I manage a group of amazing engineers, leads and managers. I love collaborating with them to create great solutions on an ongoing basis and I am quite proud of what we have built together.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front End development, specifically ES6, Html/CSS, Bootstrap and ReactJs. My forte has been backend technologies for supporting high scale, high availability systems.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about high scale systems, 99.9999 uptime, SQL Server, Redis, Microservices based architecture, C#/.net, MongoDB, Node.js and how I improve myself on an ongoing basis to be at my spiritual best.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email. See my profile for it. Or reach me via LinkedIn.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I came to this country, United States of America, with $200 in my pocket and a job to hand that I landed through my own efforts before I came here. 

- In my last gig as VP of Software Development at Stamps.com (currently known as Auctane), I grew up the ranks and managed the engineering as the company 4X its revenue during my presence there.

- I like economics, wholistic health sciences, wholistic nutrition and being environmentally wise.

- I am a long time Scientologist and my study and use of the subject has helped me greatly better myself and what I can do as a professional, a leader and what I can for others around me to better the state of play.
