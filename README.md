### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a SaaS Business suite that helps businesses manage their marketing and online presence covering Social media management, SEO, advertising, online reputation, directory listings and email marketing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front End development, specifically ES6, Html/CSS, Bootstrap and ReactJs. My forte has been backend technologies for supporting high scale, high availability systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about high scale systems, 99.9999 uptime, SQL Server, Redis, Microservices based architecture, C#/.net, MongoDB, Node.js and my religion Scientology.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email see my profile or via LinkedIn.
